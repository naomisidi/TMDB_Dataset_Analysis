# TMDB_Dataset_Analysis
Analysis of the TMDB Movie Data obtained from a csv file using Pandas and Numpy to pose questions and make findings and matlplotlib to create visualizations.

The primary objective of this investigation was to determine whether correlations exist between different characteristics of movies and popularity. Focusing on the last 10 years of the dataset, part of the investigation will also seek to determine whether the month a movie is released influences its popularity or revenue.

## Summary of Findings
* There was a high positive correlation between all the variables except movie id.
* The top ten directors with the highest popularity have released mostly 1 or 2 movies. 
* The number of movies a producer makes does not influence their popularity
* The highest revenue earned was over **2B** dollars and directed by James Cameron who does not appear on the list of directors who have produced the highest number of movies nor directors who's movies rank high in popularity.
* The longest movie produced was **900** minutes long, a documentary produced by Mark Cousins
* Most movies were released in September and the least in April.
* The months of June and December appear to be the highest revenue earners for movies in the dataset.
* Movies released in the months of June and December appear to be the most popular which corresponds to the initial analysis of revenue earned
